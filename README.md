# Affinity

This app was designed for a social impact hackathon in SF named 100Hacks. The purpose of Affinity was to connect Food Banks with Grocery Stores in order to counteract food waste. The app itself was comprised of three parts. The Food Bank interface, the Grocery interface, and a twilio based chat that enabled the homeless as well as people in need to find the nearest free meal in their area by connecting to a Firebase server. I programmed the app with the help of my friend Nathan who programmed most of the backend.

I never finished this app, it was meant for displaying purposes at the hackathon. I did work on it previously 2 weeks before the hackathon began and for this reason it is quite sophisticated. We implemented Firebase storage and database, the Twilio API with node.js while hosting on heroku severs, and of course the app itself. I would love to finish it in the future.
